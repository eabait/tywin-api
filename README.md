# Tywin
Tywin is an ongoing experiment that aims at creating a maintainable NodeJS seed/boilerplate project. The main
goal is to be more than an integration of useful libraries as most boilerplates projects are. Tywin is my search of a minimal design for a NodeJS project that applies the best of software architecture. Most inspiration is drawn from Clean Architecture and DDD (domain-driven design).
